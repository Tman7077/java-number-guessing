# Overview

This simple number guessing game was my first foray into the Java language. I have never used Java before, and I thought this would be a simple enough introduction to the language.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with a few Java extensions to code this project. I didn't use any external libraries, just a few baked-in Java things (such as java.util.Random).

# Future Work

- This program is very simplistic. It would be nice to add a few things to spice it up a little, perhaps a variation of the game that only gives you the minimum required number of guesses to guarantee it, or an entirely new gamemode.
- The program is not very smart. It doesn't know if you guessed the number as perfectly as you could (or even better), and as such does not congratulate you for doing so, just for general completion of the game. Perhaps in the future I could add such functionality.
